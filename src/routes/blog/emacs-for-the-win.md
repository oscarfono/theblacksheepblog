<span class="dropcap">T</span>his will likely come as absolutely no surprise to anyone who truly knows me but  I LOVE LOVE LOVE <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" target="_blank">Emacs</a>!   First learning of this amazing <em>editor-come-operating-system</em> back in 2010 after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016" target="_blank">The Social Network (2010)</a>, a movie about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and the inception of the hugely successful social media sensation that became <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, written by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070" target="_blank">Aaron Sorkin</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583826" target="_blank">Ben Mezrich</a>, directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399" target="_blank">David Fincher</a>, and starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986" target="_blank">Jesse Eisenberg</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005493" target="_blank">Justin Timberlake</a>. It was an unusual and unexpected, yet, fortuitously serendipitous event that has forever changed my life for the better.

Although I had been using <span title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</span> since early 2000, I had not previously had any exposure to the wonderful world of Emacs, nor would I realise, until much, much later, how revolutionary and powerful it truly was, nor how important it is choosing the right editor for your requirements.  At the time I was switching between <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> and <a href="https://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html" target="_blank">Bluefish</a> editors as well as cutting my teeth on various <span title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</span>'s including <a href="https://eclipseide.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html" target="_blank">Netbeans</a>.
