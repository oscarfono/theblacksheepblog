<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his will likely come as absolutely no surprise to anyone who truly knows me but  I absolutely LOVE <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" target="_blank">Emacs</a>!   First learning of this amazing <em>editor-come-operating-system</em> back in 2010 after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016" target="_blank">The Social Network (2010)</a>, a movie about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and the inception of the hugely successful social media sensation that became <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986" target="_blank">Jesse Eisenberg</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005493" target="_blank">Justin Timberlake</a>. It was an unusual and unexpected, yet, fortuitously serendipitous event that has forever changed my life for the better.</p>

<p>Although I had been using <span title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</span> since early 2000, I had not previously had any exposure to the wonderful world of Emacs, nor would I realise, until much later, how revolutionary and powerful it truly was.  I just knew that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)" target="_blank">VI</a> frustrated the shit out of me and still to this day, despite many attempts to use VI or VIM I much prefer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" target="_blank">Emacs</a> key combinations and have habitualised these movements to the point where I am pretty darn fast now.</p>

<p>It was a very steep learning curve for me, however, and one that continues to this day, but I'm so glad I perservered and could not imagine life without Emacs.
So I thought I'd write a little about the things that excite me the most about this wonderful piece of software.</p>

## open source
I'm all about free and open source.
## orgmode

## tramp

## community

## elisp
I realise many have strong opinions about lisp style languages and sure some of the critique may be fair and reasonable but that doesn't phase me at all as I find elisp to be very powerful and simple enough to understand.
