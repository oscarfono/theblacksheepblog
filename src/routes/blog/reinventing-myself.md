<span class="dropcap">W</span>ell it's 2024, I'm 45 years old, destitute and devoid of any kind of meaning in my life after, what has felt like, four decades of struggle and suffering. I've failed over and over again, both professionally, and personally...  I've multiple failed businesses, multiple failed relationships; including a very painful divorce that still haunts me daily.  I've failed as a father, as a friend, as a person.  I've failed to achieve virtually everything I have ever set out to do and it's high time that paradigm changed.
